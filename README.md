  # Supervised Machine Learning Analysis: Housing in London

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze the housing market in London. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses yearly variables like median salary, life satisfaction, population size, and more, we delve into classification and regression analyses to uncover insights into housing trends.

## Features

- **Classification Models**: Explore the relationship between population size and salary categories (high/low) based on median salary.
- **Regression Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between population size and mean salary to predict housing trends.

## Getting Started
