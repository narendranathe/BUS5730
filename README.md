# 1. Basic Python
   # Python Introduction Exercise: Data Management and Visualization

This repository contains exercises focused on data management and visualization using Python, particularly leveraging the pandas and seaborn libraries. The exercises are designed to guide through importing, exploring, manipulating, and analyzing a dataset concerning housing in London, with an emphasis on yearly variables.

## Dataset

The dataset used is "housing_in_london_yearly_variables.csv", which includes a variety of metrics related to the housing market in London, such as median salary, number of jobs, and more across different boroughs over several years.

## Exercises

- **Data Import and Basic Overview**: Loading the dataset and providing an initial exploration.
- **Data Exploration and Aggregation**: Analyzing unique boroughs and job numbers.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Identifying and filling missing values.
- **Advanced Data Manipulation**: Calculating salary growth and identifying high growth boroughs.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis and comparing median salaries over years.

# 2. Supervised Learning
  # Supervised Machine Learning Analysis: Housing in London

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze the housing market in London. Utilizing a dataset that encompasses yearly variables like median salary, life satisfaction, population size, and more, we delve into classification and regression analyses to uncover insights into housing trends.

## Features

- **Classification Models**: Explore the relationship between population size and salary categories (high/low) based on median salary.
- **Regression Analysis**: Investigate the correlation between population size and mean salary to predict housing trends.
