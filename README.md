   Supervised Machine Learning Analysis of London Housing Data
Overview
This repository contains Python code and datasets for performing supervised machine learning analysis on housing data in London. The project aims to explore the relationship between population size and mean salary, and how these factors affect housing variables in London through classification and regression models.

Dataset
The dataset housing_in_london_yearly_variables.csv includes yearly records of various housing-related metrics such as median salary, life satisfaction, recycling percentage, population size, number of jobs, area size, number of houses, and borough flag.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Installation
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python installed, then run:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by removing null values and converting features to appropriate formats.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implement and evaluate several machine learning models including:
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Linear Regression
For each model, the code covers training, predictions, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports for classification models, and MSE and R^2 for the regression model.
